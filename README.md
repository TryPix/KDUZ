# KDUZ
Simple terminal based platformer using Curses in Python. I completed this project with Maxime Lehmann in the scope of Mr Kessler OC Python class in CEC AndrÃ©-Chavanne. This project intentionally does not adhere to object oriented programming (as this was taught in a latter part of the class). This led to the creation of many global constants and hardcoded segments, which is usually not recommended. 

## Usage 

Curses is by installed by default on Mac and Linux versions of Python, but if on Windows, make sure to install it:
> python -m pip install windows-curses

Then, make sure to full screen a terminal application and run:
> python kduz.py
